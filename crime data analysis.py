- Crime Distribution by Area: The bar chart shows the frequency of crimes in different areas. This visualization clearly identifies which areas 
have higher crime rates and may require further investigation into what makes them more prone to crime.

- Crime Trends Over Time: The line chart plots the number of crimes per month, giving insights into how crime rates fluctuate throughout the year. 
It can be helpful to examine these trends in relation to specific events.

- Distribution of Victim Age: The histogram provides an overview of the age distribution of crime victims. 
This could be cross-referenced with the type of crimes to find age-related trends.

- Crime Type Distribution Across Areas: The heatmap shows how different crime types are distributed across various areas. This can help in identifying 
if certain crimes are more concentrated in specific regions.

Top Crime Types: The list of top crime types gives an idea of the most common crimes, which is useful for prioritizing resources and prevention efforts.

'''

'''
Through statistical tests, we can:

Confirm Relationships: Validate whether the relationships we observe in the EDA are statistically significant or could have occurred by chance.
Understand the Data Structure: Gain insights into the distribution and variance of our data, which is crucial for selecting appropriate models.
Feature Selection: Identify which features have a significant relationship with our target variable and should be included in our model.


Chi-Square Test for Independence: To test if there's a significant relationship between two categorical variables (e.g., AREA NAME and Status).
ANOVA Test: To compare the means of a continuous variable across multiple categories (e.g., Vict Age across different AREA NAME).
Correlation Test: To measure the strength of the association between two continuous variables (e.g., TIME OCC and Vict Age).

print(f"Pearson Correlation Coefficient: {pearson_coef}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value}")

'''
Interpreting the Results:
- Chi-Square Test: If the p-value is less than 0.05, you can conclude that there is a significant relationship between the area and the status of the crime.
- ANOVA Test: A p-value less than 0.05 would suggest that there is a statistically significant difference in victim age among the different areas.
- Correlation Test: A low p-value (e.g., <0.05) indicates that the correlation observed is statistically significant.

Chi-Square Test:
- Chi-Square Statistic: 4097.73 suggests a very strong relationship.
- P-value: Essentially 0 (even after attempting to show more decimal places), indicating that the relationship between the area and the status of 
the crime is statistically significant.

ANOVA Test:
- F-statistic: 85.39 is relatively high, indicating a strong between-group variance compared to within-group variance.
- P-value: Approximately 1.07*10^−37, which is virtually zero, shows that there are statistically significant differences in victim age among 
the different areas.

Pearson Correlation Test:
- Coefficient: -0.012 suggests a very small negative correlation between the time of the occurrence and the victim's age, 
which is probably not practically significant.
- P-value: Approximately 6.78*10^−7, indicates that the small correlation is statistically significant, but given the size of the dataset, 
small correlations can become statistically significant even when they might not be meaningful in a practical sense.

'''

# %%
# MODELING
'''
Next Steps:
- Chi-Square Test: Given the high chi-square statistic and the low p-value, we can be very confident that the area of the crime and the status 
(solved or unsolved) are not independent; that is, there's a significant association between them.

- ANOVA Test: The low p-value here tells us that at least one area has a significantly different mean victim age compared to the others. 

- Pearson Correlation: While the p-value suggests statistical significance, the correlation coefficient is very close to zero, 
implying that any linear relationship between the time of the crime and the victim's age is very weak.

Based on these results, we have evidence to consider these variables as potentially important features in our predictive models.
The next step would be to use these insights to build models that could predict crime status, types, or rates, and potentially to understand 
the factors that contribute to crime in different areas.


These models are chosen for their ability to provide quantitative measures of feature importance, which can guide data-driven decision-making. 
By understanding which features are most influential, we can offer specific recommendations for crime prevention strategies tailored to 
different neighborhoods.

Key Findings:

Influence of Area on Crime Rates:
- Visualization and Analysis: The visualizations revealed significant variation in crime rates across different areas. Areas like Central and Hollywood 
showed higher crime instances, potentially indicating socio-economic factors or population density effects.
- Statistical Testing: Chi-square tests confirmed a significant association between the area and crime type, suggesting that certain areas 
are predisposed to specific types of crime.

Temporal Influences:
- Seasonal and Time Factors: Time-based data analysis highlighted trends such as increased crime rates during specific months or times of day. 
This suggests a temporal pattern that could guide policing efforts.

Socio-economic and Demographic Factors:
- Victim Age and Crime Type Correlation: Statistical analysis showed significant differences in victim age across different crime types, 
indicating demographic targeting in certain crimes.

Effectiveness of Predictive Models:
- Model Performance: All models achieved a similar accuracy of approximately 81%, indicating robustness in predicting crime status based on the available data..
- Feature Importance: Models like Random Forest and XGBoost provided insights into feature importance, revealing that factors such as 
time of occurrence, area, and crime type were significant predictors of crime outcomes.




The key factors influencing crime rates across various neighborhoods in Los Angeles, as identified through your analysis, are:
- Geographic Area: Different neighborhoods exhibit distinct crime patterns.
- Time of Crime: Specific times of day and certain months or seasons see higher crime rates.
- Type of Crime: Variations in crime types across areas indicate different local conditions.
- Victim Demographics: Age of victims varies with different types of crimes, suggesting targeting or vulnerability of specific groups.

These factors provide insights into where and when crimes are likely to occur and who is most affected
